# Dimensionality Reduction on Hyperspectral Image
**The basic intuition of dimensionality reduction techniques are to reduce computation complexity and the size of data.**
## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
**PCA is a mathematical algorithm that reduces the dimensionality of the data while retaining most of the variation in the data set.**

**Following are the steps to perfrom PCA:**

*Step 1: Calculate the mean and standard deviation for each feature.*

*Step 2: Calculate the covariance matrix for the dataset*
