# Dimensionality Reduction on Hyperspectral Image
**The basic intuition of dimensionality reduction techniques is to reduce computation complexity and the size of data.**
## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
**PCA is a mathematical algorithm that reduces the dimensionality of the data while retaining most of the variation in the data set.**

**Following are the steps to perform PCA:**

*Step 1: Calculate the mean and standard deviation for each feature.*

*Step 2: Calculate the covariance matrix for the dataset*

*Step 3: Compute Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of the covariance matrix to identify the k principal components*

*Step 4: Decide on k, the number of top PCs to choose from*

*Step 5: Create the projection matrix using the number of top PCs you've chosen.*
